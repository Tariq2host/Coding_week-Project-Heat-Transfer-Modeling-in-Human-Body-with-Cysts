# Heat Transfer Modeling in Human Body with Cysts

## Project Overview
This project, developed by students of Ecole Centrale Casablanca, focuses on modeling heat transfer in the human body in the presence of cysts. Using the Pennes equation and numerical methods, the study aims to enhance the understanding and detection of diseases like breast cancer.
